Island Perimeter

Calculate the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid.

## Problem

Given a grid where `0` represents water and `1` represents land, calculate the perimeter of the island.

## Requirements

- Grid is a list of lists of integers (0 or 1)
- Each cell is a unit square
- Cells connect horizontally/vertically only
- Grid dimensions â‰¤ 100x100
- Grid is surrounded by water
- Contains at most one island
- No interior lakes

## Function Signature

```python
def island_perimeter(grid):
    """Returns the perimeter of the island in grid"""
```

## Example

```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output: 12
```
